			<description>Currently, I lead a static called High Score. As we&amp;rsquo;re limited in hours this time around, I decided to consider what would be the best use of our time going into the new Ultimate. The following is a collection of my thoughts.
Best-in-Slot (for healers) When progressing through Savage, you&amp;rsquo;re normally limited to whatever you can get your hands on. Then you go through and meld to hit comfortable spell/skill speed, piety, or whatever else stat you want to focus on.</description>

<h2 id="best-in-slot-for-healers">Best-in-Slot (for healers)</h2>
<p>When progressing through Savage, you&rsquo;re normally limited to whatever you can get your hands on. Then you go through and meld to hit comfortable spell/skill speed, piety, or whatever else stat you want to focus on. Efficiency isn&rsquo;t particularily important.</p>
<p>For healers in Ultimate, this isn&rsquo;t exactly the case.</p>
<p>First, you usually have to actually heal in Ultimate. Min-piety sets usually don&rsquo;t fly in savage progression and they definitely won&rsquo;t fly here. You&rsquo;ll need to GCD heal. Maybe because of phase changes and intermissions you can get away with it, but I wouldn&rsquo;t risk it.</p>
<p>Secondly, Ultimate usually has multiple phases and they will often have variable kill times. This means that without knowing killtimes, investing in special speed tiers tailored to kill times or phase shifts just isn&rsquo;t worth it, so I normally recommend against worrying about this stat too much. Plus the more often you cast, the more mana you use, the more piety you&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<p>My friend Qoo made this interesting (although very unrealistic) graph to show how minimum pie at various gcds affects time to OOM. You can check it out here: <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/908069150176473118/916091025905291315/unknown-3.png">Link</a></p>
<p>For the above reasons, I decided to make a few custom BiS sets and my friend Kevi joined in. Here they are:</p>

<p>Kevi&rsquo;s Low Piety Set and my High Piety Set are the two options I prepared for myself. Pretty sure the fine folks over at <a href="https://discord.gg/feys-temperance">Fey&rsquo;s Temperance</a> probably have something similar or maybe even better options than what we&rsquo;ve made. Might want to check them out.</p>
<h2 id="fight-preperationpractice">Fight Preperation/Practice</h2>
<p>Historically, I&rsquo;ve always felt that going into older fights to practice mechanics was a good use of time. Unless you&rsquo;re going into Ultimates blind, I no longer believe this to be the case.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, there is going to be so much more information available as the groups at the forefront of progression make their way through the fight that by the time the average group - even higher end groups running lighter hours - makes it into the fight, there is an immense amount of information available. It&rsquo;s simply a better use of your time, should you value it so highly, to spend a bit of time out of raid (or even during raid) organizing strats and figuring out what needs to be done rather than bashing your head into the wall blindly. Unless you&rsquo;re into that. I won&rsquo;t judge. I am too.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t meant that you can&rsquo;t or shouldn&rsquo;t do it though. We went into Thordan and Nidhog both for the experience and the enjoyment of it. They&rsquo;re fun, short fights that when run min item level no echo are pretty fun, if a bit easy with current kits and scalings.</p>
<h2 id="consumables">Consumables</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be blunt, if you&rsquo;re not going into the fight with potions and food, you&rsquo;re trolling. The number of times I see people live with sub-1000 health is more than you can imagine. And don&rsquo;t give me the heal more argument, mana is a precious resource during progression. Being able to get even a single additional res out can save a run and help you reach your next prog point even faster. Don&rsquo;t you value your own time?</p>
<p>Here is a list of consumables I prepared for myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Ethers (For the healers and casters. As I said, mana is important!)</li>
<li>Tinctures (for any DPS push; if someone dies that dps needs to come from <em>somewhere</em>&hellip;)</li>
<li>Food (Thavnairian Chai, Pumpkin Potage, or whatever is your endgame addiction.)</li>
<li>Grade 8 Dark Matter (for gear repairs if you have your crafters leveled.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A case can also be made for Super Potions, but I won&rsquo;t go out of my way to reccommend that for the moment. I may or may not have given my tanks a few to carry, though.</p>
<h2 id="get-hype">Get Hype</h2>
<p>Honestly, we don&rsquo;t get ultimate very often and they&rsquo;re great fun. Go and enjoy yourself!</p>

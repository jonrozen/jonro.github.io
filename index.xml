      <description>Currently, I lead a static called High Score. As we&amp;rsquo;re limited in hours this time around, I decided to consider what would be the best use of our time going into the new Ultimate. The following is a collection of my thoughts.
Best-in-Slot (for healers) When progressing through Savage, you&amp;rsquo;re normally limited to whatever you can get your hands on. Then you go through and meld to hit comfortable spell/skill speed, piety, or whatever else stat you want to focus on.</description>
